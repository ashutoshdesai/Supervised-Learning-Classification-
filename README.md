# Supervised_Learning_Classification

Objective 1: Create a K-nearest neighbour classifier using cross validation on the patient dataset to predict whether a patient has a malignant or benign tumor.

Objective 2: Create a K-nearest neighbour classifier using cross validation on the wine dataset to predict the type of wine.

Popular machine learning library scikit-learn was used along with a popular scientific computing library in Python, NumPy, to investigate basic machine learning principles and models.

The topics covered in this project include:

1. Introduction to scikit-learn and NumPy
2. Data preparation and cleaning with Pandas
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Nearest neighbors classification algorithm

Note: Some other useful Python libraries include matplotlib (for plotting/graphing) and Pandas (for data analysis)
